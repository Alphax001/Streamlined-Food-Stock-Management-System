We have been instructed to produce a software solution designed by using C language, which we can 
apply for a real–world problem. Therefore, our team was looking for a problem. 

And we found about four cases;  
▪ Difficulty in budgeting and financial planning in day-to-day life.  
▪ Difficulty in managing patient records, appointments, and healthcare information in a 
hospital.  
▪ Using traditional manual methods to manage library resources is time consuming and 
prone to errors.   
▪ Ineffective food stock management leads to food wastage.

Problem; 

Among them we selected one problem, and it is Ineffective food stock management. Here we are 
considering only vegetables and fruit wasting. 

Reasons for choosing this scenario; 

▪ Without having a streamlined management system for the vegetables and fruit stocking may 
lead to spoilage, expiration and increased shrinkage.  
▪ When the store is running on manual methods for tracking inventory, it can lead to 
inefficiencies, errors, and delays.  
▪ Difficulty in maintaining accurate and real-time control over inventory levels may lead to 
stockouts, overstock situations, and difficulties in tracking product movement.  
▪ As the procedure grows, managing inventory becomes more complex and a system is 
needed to handle a large volume of products, suppliers, and customer orders efficiently. 

Solutions;  

▪ Stocking vegetables and fruits in a proper way  
▪ Control inventories through a system in real-time  
▪ Maintaining a data store of product movements, suppliers, and customer orders  

Expectations from this system;  

▪ Inventory optimization  
▪ Accuracy and real-time visibility   
▪ Efficient order processing  
▪ User friendly interface  
▪ Automation of repetitive tasks  

Program steps related to the problem; 

▪ Variables that used, 
o Character variables - Item code, Item name 
o Float variables         - Quantity, Purchase price, Wholesale price, Retail price 
▪ We used flow chart and pseudo code to display our program.
